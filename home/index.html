        <h2>Tcg BootCamp</h2>
        
         <br>
        
        <p>The first day when i came here at the coding ground, i was 
        so nervous and scared because i didnt know what i was to expact
        and the moment when i saw that the sudents who were also contesting we were so many. That made everything worse knowing that we were
      in a competition fighting for the right spot.</p>

        <h2>During BootCamp</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Then i heard that the bootcamp is for section so not all of us are going to be selected 
        so the will only choose the best, then i had to make sure that i become one of the students that they select. It happend that i became 
        one of the top ten students that they selected. A week later i received an email for attending bootcamp and thats when i was relieved
        that i know for a fact that i'm in. First day of bootcamp i heard that theres two groups and the need to select only five from the then.
        Then again i had to fight my way to the top.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Wednesday they told us about an intervew that will be held at Tcg coding Ground, held by
        Joson, co-owner of the Coding Ground. During interview i was totally defferent person, i was shaking and not knowing how to respond to the
        questions they were asking. But in the end i managed to pull through.</p>

        <h2>The Coding Ground</h2>


        <p>Two weeks later i received an email confirming my acceptence at the Coding Ground. First day was okay because i started where
        i left off during bootcamp. So there comes   the time that i have realised that i went through freecodecamp but onlu to find out that 
        i have learned nothing. Then i had to start freecodecamp again but still struggling to understand the basics. For once i thought maybe this 
        institution is not meant for me but Now i have realised that the more we do projects, the more we get to understand.</p>
